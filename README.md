# Smart Indoor Environment EM RF Energy Monitor


**The Problem**

Nowadays there are a plethora of electronic devices with wireless electromagnetic (EM) capabilities. So much, is possible, for one living in a building apartment to query nearby neighboring devices. Such superposition of EM frequencies increases the risk of random (or not) energy spikes within any indoor spaces where the different devices' wireless signals exist simultaneously. The most common danger to the health of a person is found in the literature by "electromagnetic burns". Although such energy spike events are not common, when devices are setup and even programmed to broadcast in such a way are always dangerous to one's health.  


**The Idea**

This Smart Indoor Environment EM RF Energy Monitor does not solve the electromagnetic health concern one may have indoors. However, is a step forward in correctly identifying such electromagnetic disturbances nearby, for instance, when observing recurrently a mid-air energy spike, with the most common visual effect, a really small bright light flash. This smart device is able to do electromagnetic (EM) radio frequency (RF) measurements in a room and send data measurements to a local home server, alternatively to a public cloud server, for instance, to the authorities on a data repository ( see http://wwww.dataverse.org). Another important characteristic of this smart device is in the ability to deliver data to a server with a Unique Data Fingerprint Identification (UDF-ID),  which makes collected data more trustworthy of its origins.
